            Ingenuity is what is known as a technology demonstration – a project seeks to test a new capability for the first time, with limited scope. 
            <br>
            <br>
            "The ingenuity and brilliance of people working hard to overcome the challenges of interplanetary travel are what allow us all to experience the wonders of space exploration," Rupani wrote. "Ingenuity is what allows people to accomplish amazing things."
            -High school student Vaneeza Rupani of Northport, Alabama

          <p class='futureCopy'>
            Ingenuity is intended to demonstrate technologies needed for flying in the Martian atmosphere. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If successful, these technologies could enable other advanced robotic flying vehicles that might be included in future robotic and human missions to Mars. They could offer a unique viewpoint not provided by current orbiters high overhead or by rovers and landers on the ground, provide high-definition images and reconnaissance for robots or humans, and enable access to terrain that is difficult for rovers to reach.

                system that is recharged daily by a solar array 
                located atop its rotor system. Solar cells in the 
                array are optimized for the solar spectrum 
                encountered at Mars, and the stored energy is 
                used to operate heaters for the cold Martian 
                nights as well as power the helicopter during 
                flight operations. Power expended by the helicopter 
                during an up-to-90-second flight is about 350 watts.

              <p class="inspectCopy">
                Communication delays are an inherent part of working with spacecraft across interplanetary distances. Commands will need to be sent well in advance, with engineering data coming back from the spacecraft long after each flight takes place. In the meantime, Ingenuity will have a lot of autonomy to make its own decisions about how to fly to a waypoint.
                Ingenuity will communicate through the rover, which will then communicate with an orbiter that in turn communicates with Earth.

                <br>
                <br>
                Mars' thin atmosphere makes it difficult to achieve enough lift. Because the Mars atmosphere is 99% less dense than Earth's, Ingenuity has to be light, with rotor blades that are much larger and spin much faster than what would be required for a helicopter of Ingenuity's mass on Earth.

                The landing system consists of 4 legs made of tapered carbon fiber/epoxy tubes. The feet are designed to prevent the leg from digging into soft landing surfaces. They also provide some damping by scrubbing against the ground as the leg flexes. Additional energy absorption is provided by flexible deforming elements at the hinges connecting the legs to the landing gear mounting plate which is affixed to the mast. The leg designs are tested against a variety of Martian surfaces 14 ranging from hard rock to deep sand.

                The landing gear is designed to allow the landing on surface with slopes upto 10 deg in any direction with the vehicle at an additional roll (or pitch) angle of 30 deg. Vertical velocity at the height where the passive gravity drop is initiated can be as high as 2.5 m/s. A horizontal velocity of upto 0.5 m/s can be present due to delivery errors in the control system.
